# TaskX - The Task Management System
# "Get organized. Work smarter. Stay Motivated"

## Project Overview :rocket:
TaskX is a web-application which can help the users to create and maintain schedules
for their daily tasks in a smart and effective manner. The main functionality of the system
is creating daily schedules. The system helps the user in creating schedules for certain
tasks which include all sorts of activities like Homework, Assignments, Exams,
Deadlines, Meetings and so on depending on the profession of the individual. It also
provides several functionalities which can provide motivation to the user to follow the
schedule that an individual can create. The main objective of the system is to schedule the
tasks of an individual in such a manner that he can maintain the consistency of the work
done throughout the day and maximize his productivity at the end of the day. This would
prevent the user from avoiding the work to be done on the tasks that are planned or
scheduled. Satisfaction, improvement in the way of managing the tasks, relief from the
stress of pending tasks are some of the advantages that the project team wishes to provide
to the users of the system.
